def delaunay(coordinates, ids=None, bandwidth=numpy.inf, kernel="boxcar"):
    """
    Constructor of the Delaunay graph of a set of input points.
    Relies on scipy.spatial.Delaunay and numba to quickly construct
    a graph from the input set of points. Will be slower without numba,
    and will warn if this is missing.

    Parameters
    ----------
    coordinates :   array of points, (N,2)
        numpy array of coordinates containing locations to compute the
        delaunay triangulation
    **kwargs    :   keyword argument list
        keyword arguments passed directly to weights.W

    Notes
    -----
    The Delaunay triangulation can result in quite a few non-local links among
    spatial coordinates. For a more useful graph, consider the weights.Voronoi
    constructor or the Gabriel graph.

    The weights.Voronoi class builds a voronoi diagram among the points, clips the
    Voronoi cells, and then constructs an adjacency graph among the clipped cells.
    This graph among the clipped Voronoi cells generally represents the structure
    of local adjacencies better than the "raw" Delaunay graph.

    The weights.gabriel.Gabriel graph constructs a Delaunay graph, but only
    includes the "short" links in the Delaunay graph.

    However, if the unresricted Delaunay triangulation is needed, this class
    will compute it much more quickly than Voronoi(coordinates, clip=None).

    For a link (i,j) connecting node i to j in the Delaunay triangulation
    to be retained in the Gabriel graph, it must pass a point set exclusion test:

    1. Construct the circle C_ij containing link (i,j) as its diameter
